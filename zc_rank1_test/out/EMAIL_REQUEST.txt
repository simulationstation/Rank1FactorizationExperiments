Subject: Request for Zc(3900) Numeric Data Tables (π J/ψ and D D* mass spectra)

Dear BESIII Collaboration Publications Committee,

I am conducting a systematic study of amplitude factorization in exotic hadron
decays, specifically testing whether the complex production amplitude ratios
are shared across different decay channels (a "rank-1 bottleneck" test).

The Zc(3900) charged exotic state is an ideal candidate for this test, as it
was observed in two distinct final states:

1. π± J/ψ - as reported in PRL 110, 252001 (2013)
2. D D̄* - as reported in PRL 112, 022001 (2014)

I was able to find the π± J/ψ invariant mass spectrum data on HEPData
(record ins2922807, from the 2025 PWA paper). However, I could not find
the corresponding D D̄* invariant mass spectrum data.

REQUEST:
========

I am writing to request numeric tables for the following:

1. M(D D̄*) or M(DD*) invariant mass distribution from e⁺e⁻ → π± (D D̄*)∓
   at √s = 4.26 GeV (from PRL 112, 022001 or subsequent analyses)

   Specifically needed:
   - Binned M(D D̄*) mass spectrum
   - Efficiency-corrected event counts or cross section
   - Statistical and systematic uncertainties per bin
   - Background estimates if available

2. If possible, the same data at multiple center-of-mass energies
   (as available in the π J/ψ PWA analysis)

FORMAT:
=======

Any standard format would be acceptable:
- CSV/TSV with mass bins and counts
- HEPData YAML format
- ROOT histogram (TH1)
- ASCII table

PURPOSE:
========

The analysis tests whether the Zc(3900) production amplitude follows a
rank-1 factorization structure, where the relative phase and magnitude
of interfering resonance contributions should be identical across
π J/ψ and D D̄* channels if the production mechanism is universal.

This would provide important information about the nature of the Zc(3900)
(compact tetraquark vs. molecular state vs. kinematic effect).

PUBLICATION:
============

If data is provided, full acknowledgment of the BESIII collaboration and
proper citation of the original publications will be included in any
resulting analysis.

Thank you for considering this request. I understand data sharing policies
may require collaboration approval, and I am happy to provide additional
details about the planned analysis if needed.
