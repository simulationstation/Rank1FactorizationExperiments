Subject: Data Request for Rank-1 Factorization Test: X(3872)-like channel sharing

Dear Colleagues,

We are conducting a systematic study of rank-1 factorization in exotic hadron production.
We would like to request access to binned spectra or amplitude-level data for the following states:

Family: X(3872)-like channel sharing
States: X(3872), X(3872) companion (if any)
Channels: J/psi pi+ pi-, J/psi pi+ pi- pi0

Relevant publications:
- LHCb-PAPER-2020-XXX (placeholder)
- CMS-PAS-BPH-20-XXX (placeholder)

Specifically, we need:
1. Binned invariant mass spectra with uncertainties
2. Efficiency corrections (if applicable)
3. Background parameterization (optional)

The data will be used for a statistical test of production mechanism factorization.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
