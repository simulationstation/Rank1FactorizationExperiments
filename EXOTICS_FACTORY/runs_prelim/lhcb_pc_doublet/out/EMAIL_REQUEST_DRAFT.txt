Subject: Data Request for Rank-1 Factorization Test: LHCb Pc narrow doublet

Dear Colleagues,

We are conducting a systematic study of rank-1 factorization in exotic hadron production.
We would like to request access to binned spectra or amplitude-level data for the following states:

Family: LHCb Pc narrow doublet
States: Pc(4440), Pc(4457), Pc(4312) (nuisance)
Channels: J/psi p (full selection proxy), J/psi p (tight selection proxy), J/psi p (weighted proxy), Amplitude-level workspace (placeholder)

Relevant publications:
- arXiv:1904.03947
- arXiv:2007.06995

Specifically, we need:
1. Binned invariant mass spectra with uncertainties
2. Efficiency corrections (if applicable)
3. Background parameterization (optional)

The data will be used for a statistical test of production mechanism factorization.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
