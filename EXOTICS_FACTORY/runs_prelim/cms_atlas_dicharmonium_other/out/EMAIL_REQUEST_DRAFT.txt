Subject: Data Request for Rank-1 Factorization Test: CMS/ATLAS other di-charmonium families

Dear Colleagues,

We are conducting a systematic study of rank-1 factorization in exotic hadron production.
We would like to request access to binned spectra or amplitude-level data for the following states:

Family: CMS/ATLAS other di-charmonium families
States: di-J/psi structures, 4mu structures
Channels: CMS di-J/psi, ATLAS di-J/psi

Relevant publications:
- CMS PAS BPH-21-003 (placeholder)
- ATLAS-CONF-2023-XYZ (placeholder)

Specifically, we need:
1. Binned invariant mass spectra with uncertainties
2. Efficiency corrections (if applicable)
3. Background parameterization (optional)

The data will be used for a statistical test of production mechanism factorization.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
