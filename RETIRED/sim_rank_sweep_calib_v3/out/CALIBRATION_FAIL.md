## Failures

- Y-states: Type I = 0.171 (expected [0.02, 0.08])
- Di-charmonium: Type I = 0.160 (expected [0.02, 0.08])

## Recommendations

1. Check bootstrap generation matches likelihood assumptions
2. Verify optimizer convergence with more restarts
3. Check for model mismatch between generator and fitter
