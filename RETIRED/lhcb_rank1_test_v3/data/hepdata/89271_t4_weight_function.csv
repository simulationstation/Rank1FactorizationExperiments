#: description: Spline interpolation of the weight function (depending of $\cos \theta_{P_c}$) applied to $\Lambda_{b}^{0}$ candidates. The weight function is determined as the inverse of the density of $\Lambda_{b}^{0}$ candidates in the narrow pentaquark peak region while the interpolation is done between the bin centers.
