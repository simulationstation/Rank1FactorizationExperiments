Subject: Data Request for Rank-1 Factorization Test: BaBar control: phi(1680)/phi(2170)

Dear Colleagues,

We are conducting a systematic study of rank-1 factorization in exotic hadron production.
We would like to request access to binned spectra or amplitude-level data for the following states:

Family: BaBar control: phi(1680)/phi(2170)
States: phi(1680), phi(2170)
Channels: e+e- -> phi f0, e+e- -> phi pi pi

Relevant publications:
- arXiv:0708.2461
- DOI:10.1103/PhysRevD.76.012008

Specifically, we need:
1. Binned invariant mass spectra with uncertainties
2. Efficiency corrections (if applicable)
3. Background parameterization (optional)

The data will be used for a statistical test of production mechanism factorization.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
