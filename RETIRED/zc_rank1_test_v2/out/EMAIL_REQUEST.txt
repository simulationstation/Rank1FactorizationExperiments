Subject: Request for Binned Mass Spectrum Data for Zc States (D*D* and D D* channels)

Dear BESIII Collaboration Publications Committee,

I am conducting a systematic study of amplitude factorization in exotic hadron
production, testing whether complex production amplitudes are shared across
different decay channels (a "rank-1 bottleneck" test).

The Zc(4020)/Zc(4025) and Zc(3900)/Zc(3885) charged exotic states are ideal
candidates for this test, as they were observed in both hidden-charm (π hc, π J/ψ)
and open-charm (D*D*, D D*) final states.

I have obtained the following data from HEPData and arXiv sources:

FOUND:
1. M(π± J/ψ) binned mass spectra from HEPData record 166173 (PWA paper 2025)
2. σ(e⁺e⁻ → π⁺π⁻ h_c) cross sections from arXiv:1309.1896 (13 energy points)
3. Zc(4020) yields from arXiv:1309.1896 (3 energy points)

NOT FOUND (crucial for rank-1 test):
1. Binned M(D*D̄*) or M(D*⁺D̄*⁰) invariant mass spectrum
2. Binned M(D D̄*) or M(D⁰D̄*⁻) invariant mass spectrum

REQUEST:
========

I am writing to request numeric tables for the following:

1. M(D*D̄*) invariant mass distribution from e⁺e⁻ → π± (D*D̄*)∓
   at √s = 4.26 GeV (from PRL 112, 132001 or subsequent analyses)

   Specifically needed:
   - Binned M(D*D̄*) mass spectrum (from Fig. 4 of arXiv:1308.2760)
   - Efficiency-corrected event counts or cross section per bin
   - Statistical uncertainties per bin
   - Background model or sideband estimates if available

2. M(D D̄*) invariant mass distribution from e⁺e⁻ → π± (D D̄*)∓
   at √s = 4.26 GeV (from PRL 112, 022001 or subsequent analyses)

   Specifically needed:
   - Binned M(D D̄*) mass spectrum (from Fig. 2 of arXiv:1310.1163)
   - For both π⁺D⁰ and π⁻D⁺ tag samples if available

3. If possible, the same spectra at additional center-of-mass energies
   (4.23, 4.36 GeV as in the π hc analysis)

FORMAT:
=======

Any standard format would be acceptable:
- CSV/TSV with mass bins and counts
- HEPData YAML format
- ROOT histogram (TH1)
- ASCII table

PURPOSE:
========

The analysis tests whether the Zc production amplitude follows a rank-1
factorization structure. The model is:

   I_α(m) = |BW₁(m) + R_α BW₂(m)|² + B_α(m)

We test whether the complex ratio R is shared across channels:
- M₀ (null): R_πhc = R_D*D* (universal production)
- M₁ (alt): R_πhc ≠ R_D*D* (channel-dependent)

This would provide important constraints on the nature of the Zc states
(compact tetraquark vs. molecular state vs. kinematic effect).

ALTERNATIVE:
============

If binned mass spectra cannot be provided, multi-energy yield data would
allow a weaker "shared-coupling" test:
- Zc(4025) → D*D* yields at √s = 4.23, 4.26, 4.36 GeV
- Zc(3885) → D D* yields at multiple energies

PUBLICATION:
============

If data is provided, full acknowledgment of the BESIII collaboration and
proper citation of the original publications will be included in any
resulting analysis.

Thank you for considering this request. I understand data sharing policies
may require collaboration approval, and I am happy to provide additional
details about the planned analysis.
