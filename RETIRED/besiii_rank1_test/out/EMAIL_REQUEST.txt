Subject: Request for HEPData Submission - Cross Section Tables for pi+pi- J/psi and pi+pi- psi(3686)

Dear BESIII Collaboration,

I am conducting a physics analysis that requires the numerical cross-section data from two of your important publications:

1. "Precise measurement of the e+e- -> pi+pi- J/psi cross section at center-of-mass energies from 3.77 to 4.60 GeV"
   - Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 092001 (2017)
   - DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.092001
   - arXiv: 1611.01317

2. "Cross section measurement of e+e- -> pi+pi- psi(3686) from sqrt(s)=4.0076 to 4.6984 GeV"
   - Phys. Rev. D 104, 052012 (2021)
   - DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.104.052012
   - arXiv: 2107.09210

I am specifically looking for machine-readable tables containing:
- Center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) [GeV]
- Born cross section sigma [pb]
- Statistical uncertainty
- Systematic uncertainty (or total uncertainty if not separated)
- Integrated luminosity per energy point (if available)

I have searched HEPData (https://www.hepdata.net) but could not find these datasets submitted there. The cross-section tables appear in the supplemental material of the papers, but these are in PDF format and not suitable for precision analysis.

Could you please consider one of the following:

1. **Preferred**: Submit the cross-section tables to HEPData
   - HEPData provides a permanent, citable record
   - The submission process is documented at https://www.hepdata.net/submission
   - Your HEPData coordinator can assist with the upload

2. **Alternative**: Provide the data as CSV or plain text files
   - These could be added to the arXiv record as ancillary files
   - Or shared directly via email

The data would enable important phenomenological studies of the Y-state resonances, including tests of the resonance structure consistency across different decay channels.

Thank you very much for your consideration. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
